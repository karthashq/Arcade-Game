# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
  This is one of the projects I had to do for the Udacity frontend nanodegree program. . It is a simple arcade game built using
  Canvas and JavaScript.

## How to run the game?
 * It is very simple. Just visit this [link.](https://karthashq.github.io/Arcade-Game/)
 * You can download the repository from [here](https://github.com/karthashq/Arcade-Game/archive/master.zip) and play locally..

## HOW TO PLAY?

  * Make the player reach the river 15 times to win the game.
  * You have 5 lives to achieve this.
  * You loose a life every time you collide with the bugs and caterpillars.
  * The star on the top-right corner indicates the number of times you have reached the river.
  * The heart indicates the lives you have remaining.
  * You lose when you lose all the 5 lives before reaching the river.

## Controls
  * Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move the player on the screen respectively.
  * Press Enter anytime to restart the game.


## Things to Know
  **Do not press "*ENTER*" when playing unless you want to restart. It will reset the game.**.

## Updates to do
  * Add sounds and background music to the game.
  * Add collectible gems to the game.
  * Add effects when collision occurs.
